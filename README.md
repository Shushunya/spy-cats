Simplified spy cats implemented with FastAPI 

tools used:
- Python
- FastAPI
- SQLModel
- db: sqlite

how to run the code:
1. pull this repository
2. create a virtual environment using Python: `python -m venv venv`
3. activate the newly created virtual environment by typing:  `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
4. install all the required libs: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. run the code with: `fastapi dev main.py`

These steps will start the backend server locally on your PC and you will be prompted to go to the localhost page. 

You can access the documentation of the API by adding `/docs` to the original localhost path. There you will be able to see all of the implemented functionaly and try it yourself.
